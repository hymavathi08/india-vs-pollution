# india-vs-pollution
An AI-powered system to identify pollution sources across air, water, land, and noise in India, enable citizen reporting, analyze pollution data, and escalate issues to authorities while tracking actions taken.
# 🌍 AI for Bharat – India vs Pollution

## 📌 Problem Statement
India is facing a severe pollution crisis that impacts public health, climate, and economic productivity. Air, water, and land pollution data exist across multiple sources, but they are fragmented, hard to understand, and not actionable for common citizens or local authorities. There is a lack of an integrated, intelligent system that can analyze pollution data and provide meaningful insights and solutions.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build an AI-powered platform that analyzes pollution data across India and presents:
- Real-time pollution insights
- Predictive analysis
- Region-wise pollution trends
- Actionable recommendations for citizens and policymakers

This project aligns with the **AI for Bharat** initiative by focusing on scalable, India-centric, socially impactful AI solutions.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**India vs Pollution** is an AI-driven system that:
- Collects pollution-related data (air, water, industrial emissions, traffic)
- Uses AI/ML models to analyze and predict pollution levels
- Visualizes pollution hotspots on an interactive dashboard
- Suggests preventive measures and awareness actions

The platform aims to make pollution data **simple, accessible, and useful**.
